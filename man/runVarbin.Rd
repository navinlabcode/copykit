\description{
runVarbin performs the variable binning (VarBin) algorithm to a series of BAM
files resulting from short-read sequencing.
}
\details{
runVarbin is a convenient wrapper for CopyKit's pre-processing module.
It runs \code{runCountReads}, \code{runVst} and, \code{runSegmentation}.

\code{runCountReads} takes as input duplicate marked BAM files from whole
genome sequencing and runs the variable binning pipeline algorithm. Briefly,
the genome is split into pre-determined bins. The bin size is controlled by
the argument \code{bin_size}. By using VarBin, for a diploid cell, each bin
will receive equal amount of reads, controlling for mappability.
A lowess function is applied to perform GC correction across the bins. The argument
\code{genome} can be set to 'hg38' or 'hg19' to select the scaffolds genome
assembly.
Information regarding the alignment of the reads to the bins and from the bam
files are stored in the #' \code{\link[SummarizedExperiment]{colData}}.

\code{runVst} performs variance stabilization to reduce the overdispersion
from the negative binomial distribution nature of the bin counts and reduce
technical bias. The argument \code{vst} controls the choice of the transformation
allowing either the Freeman-Tukey transformation by using the option 'ft' (recommended)
or a logarithmic transformation with the option 'log'. Using a 'log' transformation
may result in long segmentation times for a few cells with large breakpoint counts.

\code{runSegmentation} Fits a piece-wise constant function to the transformed
the smoothed bin counts. Bin counts are smoothed with
\code{\link[DNAcopy]{smooth.CNA}}. Segmentation can be chosen to one of the
following:

\itemize{

   \item{CBS:} \code{runSegmentation} Fits a piece-wise constant function
   to the transformed the smoothed bin counts. Bin counts are smoothed with
   \code{\link[DNAcopy]{smooth.CNA}} using the Circular Binary Segmentation
   (CBS) algorithm from \code{\link[DNAcopy]{segment}} with default it applies
   undo.prune with value of 0.05.

   \item{multipcf:} Performs the joint segmentation from the \code{copynumber}
   package using the \code{\link[copynumber]{multipcf}} function. By fitting
   piecewise constant curves with common breakpoints for all samples.


}

The resulting segment means are further refined with MergeLevels to join
adjacent segments with non-significant differences in segmented means.
