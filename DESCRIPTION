Description: A suite of tools for single cell copy number analysis 
        focusing on reads binning, segmentation, normalization, 
        filtering, analysis, and visualization. CopyKit extends Bioconductorsâ€™ 
        SingleCellExperiment class for the analysis of copy number datasets.
        We divide CopyKit functions into four modules: 1) Pre-processing,
        2) Quality Control, 3) Data Analysis, and 4) Visualization. CopyKit
        can be applied to a broad applications for studying diverse areas of 
        cancer biology, including intratumor heterogeneity, premalignant 
        progression, and metastasis.
